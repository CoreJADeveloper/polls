# polls

This is the very beginning of my Django learning. I developed this application within 5 days but i know for a expert it shouldn't take more than 1 day. I think a new beginner of Django can use this application to understand basic things.

The application is a poll manager where only logged in user can vote to a poll. A guest only can see all polls of the site also graphical representation of totall given votes within current year.

Many new features can be added within the application. Please feel free to pull request to solve any problem to current code.
