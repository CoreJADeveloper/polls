# Poll Manager

This is very beginning of my Django learning. I developed this application within 5 days but i know for an expert it shouldn't take more than 1 day. A new Django beginner can use this application to understand basic things.

The application is a poll manager where only logged in user can vote for a poll. A guest only can see all polls of the site and graphical representation of total given votes within current year.

Many new features can be implemented for the application. Please feel free to pull request to solve any problem to current code.
